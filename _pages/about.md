I am [Etsuko Ishii](https://etsukoksute.github.io) (石井悦子), an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Before joining AWS, I completed my PhD at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/home)) under Prof. Pascale Fung.

The pronunciation of "Etsuko (/etsɯᵝko/)" is similar to "Let's go"; drop the first "l" and then replace "g" with "k". The pronunciation of "Ishii (/iɕii/)" is similar to "ECE".

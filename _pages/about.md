I am [Etsuko Ishii](https://etsukoksute.github.io) (石井悦子), a PhD Candidates at Electronic & Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/home)) and part of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research ([CAiRE](https://hltchkust.github.io)) under Prof. Pascale Fung. My current research focuses on dialogue systems and question answering.

The pronunciation of "Etsuko (/etsɯᵝko/)" is similar to "Let's go"; drop the first "l" and then replace "g" with "k". The pronunciation of "Ishii (/iɕii/)" is as same as "ECE".
